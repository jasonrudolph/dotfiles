  # CC setting suggested by rvm
  # ===========================
  # For Lion, Rubies should be built using gcc rather than llvm-gcc. Since
  # /usr/bin/gcc is now linked to /usr/bin/llvm-gcc-4.2, add the following to
  # your shell's start-up file.  (The situation with LLVM and Ruby may improve. 
  # This is as of 07-23-2011.)
