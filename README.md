## Jason Rudolph's Dot Files

These are config files to set up a system the way I like it.


## Installation

    git clone git://github.com/jasonrudolph/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
    cd ~/.dotfiles
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    rake install


## Environment

I am running on Mac OS X, but I hope to gradually adapt this project to
work on my Linux systems as well.

I use bash as my shell.
